> The origin of Randomizer-CS2 stemmed from our desire to playfully troll each other while spectating matches. Imagine
> forcing someone to jump at the worst moment, making them fire unexpectedly, or even dropping their weapon mid-fight!
> Lacking the resources for a dedicated server, we opted for a software solution that everyone could use to trigger
> these
> random actions. This marked the birth of Randomizer-CSGO, now known as Randomizer-CS2.
