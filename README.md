## üéÆ About

Randomizer-CS2 is a powerful JavaFX application that allows you to create custom sequences of random actions to trigger them
randomly in Counter-Strike 2. Make your friends in the game jump, shoot, reload, or drop their weapons at unfavorable
moments ‚Äì all without injecting into the game itself. Perfect for streamers, content creators, or anyone looking to add an element of chaos to their CS2 gameplay!

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Custom Action Sequences**: Create, save, and manage your own sequences of game actions
* **Random Triggering**: Actions are triggered randomly based on your configured time intervals
* **Sequence Builder**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating action sequences
* **Interrupt Control**: Easily stop actions stopping the Randomizer or closing CS2
* **Game Focus Detection**: Automatically pauses when CS2 is not in focus
* **Non-Intrusive**: Works without game injection or modification (no VAC ban risk)
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern JavaFX UI with smooth animations
* **Lightweight**: Minimal system resource usage
* **Open Source**: Fully customizable and community-driven

> The origin of Randomizer-CS2 stemmed from our desire to playfully troll each other while spectating matches. Imagine
> forcing someone to jump at the worst moment, making them fire unexpectedly, or even dropping their weapon mid-fight!
> Lacking the resources for a dedicated server, we opted for a software solution that everyone could use to trigger
> these random actions. This marked the birth of Randomizer-CSGO, now known as Randomizer-CS2.
