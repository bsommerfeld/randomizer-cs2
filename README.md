## üéÆ Overview

**Randomizer-CS2** is a powerful JavaFX application that adds an element of unpredictability to Counter-Strike 2
gameplay. It allows you to create and trigger random action sequences without modifying the game itself.

Whether you want to prank friends, create entertaining content, or add a challenge to your gameplay, Randomizer-CS2
offers a user-friendly solution with no risk of VAC bans.

> **The Story Behind Randomizer-CS2**
>
> This project began as a fun way to troll friends during spectated matches. We wanted to make players jump at the worst
> moments, fire unexpectedly, or drop weapons mid-fight. Without access to a dedicated server, we created this software
> solution that anyone could use to trigger random actions. What started as Randomizer-CSGO has evolved into the more
> refined Randomizer-CS2.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is Randomizer-CS2 safe to use?

Yes! Randomizer-CS2 doesn't inject code into CS2 or modify game files. It works by simulating keyboard and mouse inputs,
which is completely safe and won't trigger VAC bans.

### Can I use this in competitive matches?

While technically possible, we recommend using Randomizer-CS2 in casual game modes or private matches to avoid
negatively impacting competitive gameplay for others. Or queue as a 5-stack!

### How do I create my own sequences?

Use the built-in Sequence Builder to drag and drop actions into a custom sequence. See
the [Creating Custom Sequences](#-creating-custom-sequences) section for detailed instructions.

### Does this work with other games?

Randomizer-CS2 is specifically designed for Counter-Strike 2, but the underlying technology could work with other games.
Future versions might include support for additional games.

### Where can I get help if I have issues?
